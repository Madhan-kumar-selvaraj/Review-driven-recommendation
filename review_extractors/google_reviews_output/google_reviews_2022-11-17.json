I came here for my delivery and i must admit it that the care they take for every patient is so astonishing. The main reason we chose this hospital is because of its infrastructure and facilities. The hospital has 24/7 laboratories, medicals, scan centre n everything under one roof so we need not have to go out for the scans especially during this pandemic. It has security guards everywhere to see to it that everyone follows covid protocols so as to ensure the safety of their patients. They also have bunch of nurses to help us out the very second we were in need of any help. I was so afraid of the c-section but then the way Dr. Rohini handled the things , she gave me so much confidence and everything went so smoothly which was all because of her experience. We opted for the suit room which made us feel like we were never in a hospital. Nurses were always there with us all throughout to help us in feeding and everything. The hospital had also arranged a breast feeding session to teach me how to feed the baby which was very helpful. The physician and the dietitian constantly visited me everyday to help me out. Our baby was taken care by Dr. Aravind , who constantly checked the baby twice everyday. Senior Nurse Parvathi was the one who was there with me clearing all my doubts by hearing me out and gave me  the mental strength to battle out the first two days after my delivery. As i said, we came here for its infrastructure and facilities but now, I\u2019ll recommend this hospital for not just for its facilities but also for the care shown by the doctors and the nurses.

The doctors, sisters, physiotherapist took care of me and baby nicely. After delivery I and my baby were asked to come for checkup. During that time, asusual I was happy with the checkup done for me. But for my baby, there was feeding issues. Baby was not intaking the milk properly. We were asked to go to NICU and get train on how to feed the baby. Though they teach me during delivery, again the NICU sister taught me scolding, \"don't u know how to hold the baby while feeding, don't u knw how to sit while feeding\". Though I know those things already, I didn't follow that in the home because I and my baby were more comfortable with other position while feeding. Then we were taught the things and were asked to come again after a week by the doctor. After a week when we went to checkup, the baby's weight remains the same. The baby's in take was not proper. But they are just keep on blaming on my feeding position. And again we were asked to go to NICU and meet Amudha(I think so she must be head nurse for baby's). I, my mom and my baby went. In home I will get help from my mom while feeding, lifting baby from floor. She asked me to feed the baby infront of her to check whether I know how to feed. At that time the baby was screaming and shaking her head, hands and legs vigorously. Mrs.Amudha was scolding me not to hold the baby in 2 hands. How can I able to hold the baby in a single hand while she is doing like that? At that time my mom, hold the baby to help help me feed. Then Mrs.Amudha started to scold my mom saying, \"y r u holding the baby?, only she should take the baby and feed\". Then she turned to me and asked, \"is ur mom servant to u?, can't u do things on ur own, is feeding a very big thing? Can't you able to feed ur baby by yourself?\" After scolding me like this, she turned to my mom and told her that she should not touch the baby hereafter. We were hurted alot by the behavior of Mrs.Amutha. I was 22 years old and this was my first child. How can a new mom handle this situation without using 2hands and without getting help?

Every month during pre delivery checkup physiotherapist instruct about the exercises to be followed which prepares our body to support for labour.Also they bring specialized doctors so the important scans and other tests can be done at the hospital itself. Post delivery the nurses take good care of mother and baby. Pediatric Dr. Aravindhkumar clears any doubts about baby\u2019s health without making us panic. About billing,they have packages for normal and c section. VBAC is little pricey compared to first time normal delivery and costed me around 78k just for two days including medicine and Sunday charges (as my delivery was on Sunday which they charge around 5K). If you are having mediassist insurance, even though it\u2019s in network hospital, they don\u2019t support cashless claim and we have to go through all the reimbursement process.

Even none of the hospital they are not charging this much level for room rent and doctor fees for surgery. 2) Insurance & billing department is totally waste in terms of cashless claim and they will not provide any receipts for some additional payments which we are paying apart from cashless claim. They will not share any room rent break-ups/Doctor fees etc at the time of admission. Though they are sharing the bills,they will mention high charges.Please don't encourage this hospital for any corporate cashless facilities. Insurance department person behavior is not professional and he will behave/treat us as very low level. Really its surprised when we opt the cashless claim and we decided never will go for further treatments from our family's and my relatives. 3) Nurses very new and they don't have sufficient knowledge. example: Writing of wrong blood report of patient and giving some other patients reports which is not relevant to admission date.

It was concluded that the root cause was due to urinary infection. As any loved one of a patient would feel, we felt that it was not safe to keep a 84 year old person in a hospital especially during this pandemic situation. Hence, out of genuine concern, we had asked the pulmonologist Dr. Uma Shankar as to by when we can get my grandfather discharged. The very fact that we asked this question just twice, seemingly angered him to an extent that he asked us to get my grandfather discharged immediately. Guess he tried his hand at sarcasm which is expected from a stand up comedian or an English professor but not from a supposedly competent doctor to the attendants of the patient. Further, He went on to try his hand at astrology by guessing the reason for us asking for an early discharge potentially ranging, from us having a weekend outing plan, all the way till us not wanting to spend money on an elderly patient as it would be a sunk cost with nil returns on investment. Ofcourse, I am a banking professional. But I would wear my grandson's hat (removing my banker's hat) in this case, as that is more appropriate. We only wanted his expertise as a pulmonologist and not as a fortune teller or mind reader! Also, post discharge, it was cumbersome for us to even understand which hospital we needed to visit for an outpatient consultation with my aged grandfather stranded for post discharge care. That's for another day though. Otherwise, care from nurses and other support staff were upto the mark.", "name": "", "address": "", "images": "", "review_availability": true, "url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=Care 24 Medical Center \\\\u0026 Hospital erode#lrd=0x3ba9660491daeb3b:0x181bce5c756c04e1,1,,,", "extraction_date": "2022-11-17 17:45:26"}
